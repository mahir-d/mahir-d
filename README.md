### Hi there, I'm Mahir 👋

💻I am a Computer Science graduate student from Stevens Institute of Technology. Currently working as a SDE 2 at Amazon Web services.
🙋🏻‍♂️I love to brainstorm and come up with solutions to problems that I come across in my life. The project I am most proud about would be MixUp. It is a cross-platform music streaming web application that integrates songs from Spotify and Youtube to create a consistent playlist. You can find it in my repositories.

- 🏃🏻‍♂️In my free time, I love to go out for a run or try various HIIT workouts
