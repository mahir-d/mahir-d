### Hi there, I'm Mahir 👋

💻I am a Computer Science graduate student from Stevens Institute of Technology.
🙋🏻‍♂️I love to brainstorm and come up with solutions to problems that I come accross in my life. The project I am most proud about would be MixUp. It is a cross platform music streaming web application that integrates songs from Spotify and Youtube to create a consistent playlist. You can find it in my repositories.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a dynamic task scheduler for a crowdsourced development platform using Genetic Algorithm working as a research assistant
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and reading up on various good practices for the framework
- 🏃🏻‍♂️In my free time, I love to go out for a run or try various HIIT workouts
